# How to test the package?
The root of this folder is a Unity project, so opening this folder with Unity will load everything up. The package code is located in the Packages folder, where it can be modified freely. When opening Unity, with this root folder, testing can be done through the test runner. If needed the packages can also be moved to another project, the test project is not necessary in order to run the tests. But the testproject depend on the packages inside of the Packages folder.
